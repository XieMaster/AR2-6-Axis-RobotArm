# AR2 Raspberry Pi Source Files
Contributed by Zach Allen

This code is modified from the software version `2.1.5` so you can drive the AR2 Robot with a Raspberry Pi.  You can use a keyboard, mouse, and monitor with the RPi, or configure it as an access point and connect to it remotely from a tablet or phone using VNC Viewer.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you're using a complete version of Raspbian.  This has not been tested on other OS versions.  Find the latest Raspbian distribution at Raspberry Pi's [Download](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) page.

## Getting Started and Installation

Once the files are on your Raspberry Pi, follow the links below to complete the set-up procedure.

1. Follow the [Configure RPi](ref/CONFIGURE.md) guide to clone the GitHub repository to your RPi and to properly set up the configuration settings for the following steps.
2. Follow the [Desktop Shortcut](ref/SHORTCUT.md) guide to add a clickable shortcut to your desktop to easily launch the program.
3. Follow the [Run-on-Boot](ref/RUN-ON-BOOT.md) guide to configure the program to launch automatically when you start the RPi.
4. Follow the [Access Point](ref/AP-SETUP.md) guide to set up your RPi to connect to it remotely, via a phone or tablet using VNC.

## Using the program

Plug the USB into the Raspberry Pi and the Arduino, give power to the Arduino and the AR2, and you will be all set to run the AR2 software.  Please see Chris's [documentation](https://www.anninrobotics.com/downloads) for using the software.
