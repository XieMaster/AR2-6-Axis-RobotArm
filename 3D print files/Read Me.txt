COVERS AND SPACERS:
   *the original folder contains the initial models that were designed for either 3d printing or having the components cut on a waterjet.  These models are not the current recomended for use.
   *the optimized folder contains models that are consolidated for optimal 3d printing.  The J5 cover also has additional clearance for J5 pulley. These are the current recommended models for use.

STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS:

   There are 2 folders here that contain the primary component files, the nominal files are exactly the same as the aluminum parts.  When I printed the parts on my inexpensive Davinci printer I had    trouble with shrink and bearing fit - I spent a great deal of time test printing and modifying many of the components to account for shrink.  The resized components work well for many people and    others with higher quality printers report the nominal files work better.  I have provided both sets of files here - if the resized parts have size issues for you please use the nominal files.

   The Remixed for large print bed folder contains 4 parts courtesy of Gary Heathman - these parts are ideal for people who have larger size printers and wish to print a couple of the larger    assemblies in a single piece.
